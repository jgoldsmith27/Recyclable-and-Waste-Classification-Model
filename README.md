Presentation Slides linked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ms8EEEM6BegDRybc0nQp-yT8ufclPX8v7us3Wn3yYUM/edit?slide=id.g352744a9fc9_0_57#slide=id.g352744a9fc9_0_57)

This repository contains a pipeline for training, evaluating, and experimenting with a waste classification model using image data. The project includes dataset exploration, training scripts with tunable hyperparameters, and model testing.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Explore the Dataset

Begin by running the `exploring-the-dataset.ipynb` notebook. This will:

- Download the processed waste image dataset.
- Provide basic visualizations and statistics to help you understand the data.

### 2. Train the Model

To train a model, run the training script from the terminal:

```bash
python waste_classification_train.py
